+++ Explanation
+ I'll assume:
    - I don't have to mount an entire Django to use a Django model, is not part of the algorithm
    - I can change the solution for what i think is the best
    - This part of the challenge hasn't just a script as output
+ Notes:
    - I won't build the projected_sameday_turns because is the same as projected_turns
